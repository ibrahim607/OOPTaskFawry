## Product Types

Configured in the `Product` constructor:

| Product      | Price | Weight (g) | Shippable | Expirable |
|--------------|-------|------------|-----------|-----------|
| Cheese       | 100   | 200        | Yes       | Yes       |
| Biscuit      | 150   | 700        | Yes       | Yes       |
| TV           | 200   | 2000       | Yes       | No        |
| Scratchcard  | 50    | 0          | No        | No        |

## How Checkout Works

1. Subtotal = sum of (price Ã— quantity) for each cart item  
2. Shipping fee = 10.0 per shippable unit  
3. Customer balance must cover (subtotal + shipping)  
4. Shippable items are passed to the `ShippingService`  
5. Receipt and shipment summary printed to console
